# GodWatch for node.js

GodWatch is a remote system uptime monitor running with node.js.

To set up, you will need node and mongodb installed. You should also install nodemon to automatically restart the server on uncaught exceptions.

```
git clone https://github.com/Samusoidal/node-godwatch/ godwatch
cd godwatch
mongodb --dbpath data; nodemon server.js
```

Oh, and by the way IT'S NOT DONE! YAY!!!
Don't use it yet!
